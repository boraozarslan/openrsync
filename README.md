This is a clean-room implementation of [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/)
with a BSD (ISC) license.  It is designed to be compatible with a modern
rsync (3.1.3 is used for testing).  It runs only upon
[OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org), although porting the system is
trivial.

This project is still very new and very fast-moving.  It's not
ready for wide-spread testing.  Or even narrow-spread beyond getting all
of the bits to work goodishly.  It's not ready for strong attention.  Or
really any attention but by careful programming.

See
[rsync.5](https://github.com/kristapsdz/openrsync/blob/master/rsync.5)
for protocol details or utility documentation in
[openrsync.1](https://github.com/kristapsdz/openrsync/blob/master/openrsync.1).

This repository is a read-only mirror of a private CVS repository.  I
use it for issues and pull requests.  **Please do not make feature
requests**: I will simply close out the issue.
